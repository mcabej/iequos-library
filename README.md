# iEquos Coding Challenge

iEquos have a small problem that we want you to complete in React. The emphasis here is on how you structure your project, your UI layout and flow.

The solution must be runnable at the end, so that we can test.

We envisage the task to take around 3hrs and we are expecting a functional solution. The UI should be simple but intuitive and should be at the very least responsive.

## The Problem

We want to model the local library. The library has 3 sections - Fiction, Non-Fiction and Magazines.

The application should allow the user to

- create a library
- add the three sections
- add some simple books to each section.

Other requirements include:

- Books must have an author and a title, so the data entry forms should have some data validation
- There should be some basic navigation too.

You can submit the challenge either by zip, GitHub or BitBucket. Additional points are available for your solution to be deployed to a url on your chosen platform.

Good luck!
